# Celeste Save Files :strawberry:

What a great game! This is just to sync my save files from my desktop to my laptop. I'm using the itch.io version btw.

## Where is the Saves directory?

- Mac directory: ~/Library/Application Support/Celeste/Saves
- Winddows directory: <where-you-put-it>/Celeste/Saves

## Quickly Save and Update

- Mac: create aliases in your `.zshrc` or wherever your terminal loads stuff from
    - `alias celeste-pull="cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Celeste/Saves && make pull"`
    - `alias celeste-push="cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Celeste/Saves && make push"`

- Windows: I hate windows and I'm too lazy, so just go to the directory and use the Makefile lol
